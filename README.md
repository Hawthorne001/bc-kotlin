# The Bouncy Castle Crypto Package for Kotlin

The Bouncy Castle Crypto package for Kotlin is a set of Kotlin classes designed to go on top of the Bouncy Castle Crypto Java APIs. The classes can be run with either the general BC APIs or the BC-FJA FIPS version.

Except where otherwise stated, this software is distributed under a license based on the MIT X Consortium license. To view the license, [see here](https://www.bouncycastle.org/licence.html). The BC Java OpenPGP library also includes a modified BZIP2 library which is licensed under the [Apache Software License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/).

## Code Organisation

The **kcrypto** module provides the core functionality for the library.

The **examples** module provides examples of DSL use for various features, such as X.509 certificate and CRL generation, as well PKCS#10 certification requests.

The **scripts** directory contains easily modifiable kotlin scripts to generate keys and certificate chains.

## Building

The gradle script has been tested with gradle-6.8 and later. It appears they fail if a version of gradle later than 7.3 is used.

To build put desired versions of BC jars in the directory bc-jars-reg and build with:

> gradle build

BC version 1.77b09 or later is required to build due to PQC support. Beta versions (those with a b in them) can be found at https://www.bouncycastle.org/betas

## Running

Kotlin needs to be installed. 

On Ubuntu:

`sudo snap install kotlin --classic`

After that, needed kotlin libraries are added to the lib folder for you, and you can easily run the examples and scripts. Modify them and have fun.

### Scripts
Examples of running kotlin script examples:

`kotlinc -cp kcrypto/build/libs/bc-kcrypto-0.0.9.jar:bc-jars-fips/bc-fips-1.0.2.3.jar:bc-jars-fips/bcpkix-fips-1.0.6.jar -script scripts/MakeFullPath.kts`

`kotlin -cp kcrypto/build/libs/bc-kcrypto-0.0.9.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcprov-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcpkix-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcutil-jdk18on-173.jar scripts/Falcon.kts`

You can also run kotlin interactively like:
```
kotlin -cp kcrypto/build/libs/bc-kcrypto-0.0.9.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcprov-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcpkix-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcutil-jdk18on-173.jar
>>> :load scripts/Falcon.kts
```

# Code
How to run code examples:

Build to code (into .class files)
```
cd examples
gradle build
cd ..
```
Run 'main' methods in the examples:

`kotlin -cp kcrypto/build/libs/bc-kcrypto-0.0.9.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcprov-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcpkix-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcutil-jdk18on-173.jar:examples/build/classes/kotlin/main MakeV3SelfSignedCertificateKt`

For hybrid certificates and CRL (X.509 alternative signatures):

`kotlin -cp kcrypto/build/libs/bc-kcrypto-0.0.9.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcprov-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcpkix-jdk18on-173.jar:bc-jars-reg/bcutil-jdk18on-173.jar:examples/build/classes/kotlin/main MakeDualCertificateAndDualCrlKt`
